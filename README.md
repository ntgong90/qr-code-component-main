## My process
- Build out each div/element out by scratch in vanilla JS
- Style with flexbox
- Match .jpg/.png files with website/webpage
- Submit work

### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- GitHub Pages

### What I learned
After learning ReactJS, going back to vanilla HTML/CSS is a bit awkward and I had to relearn basic HTML5/CSS.

### Continued development
I need to work on how flexbox works with vanilla JS when building a static site from scratch. In the future this will be converted to a full ReactJS app. My CCS is also very rusty.

### Useful resources
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Learned how to deploy the static page to a live website on GitHub
- [MDN Web Docs CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) - MDM web resource for CSS/flexbox sytnax.
- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - First google result when trying to find a flexbox guide.
